# cv-project

CV App built with HTML, CSS and React JS. Part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) curriculum.
* My first attempt to build a react app from scratch, mostly focused on using props and state.
* Made with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
* Built with react class components first and then refactored with functional components using hooks.


Core functionality:
* Handles user input and displays it on the preview form.
